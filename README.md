## Capital Gains Calculator

Needed to do my taxes and took a while calculaing capital gains per stock. Decided to make a calculator that takes in a transactions tables and uses
either the FIFO Method or LIFO Method to calculate capitgal gains.

## Capital Gain per Bundle Table

Calculates the gain/loss for bundle of stock purchased. This table also adds up the gain/loss of each bundle and shows the net gain/loss for that stock

## Remaining Stocks Table

After accounting for sell offs, showcases the net remainder of stocks that should be used for next financial year.
